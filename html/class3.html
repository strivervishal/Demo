<h1>A Simple, Easy to Remember URL:</h1> 
<p>If you are a new business, one without a website, you may be excited to get one up and running as soon as possible. But make sure you do the research and take a calculated approach when it comes to deciding on a URL. Consider your business goals and make sure whatever you choose is memorable. A few guidelines: Simple is better; the URL should be marketable and easy for users to type into their browser's address bar. Also, a good rule of thumb: Stick with .com or .org web addresses whenever possible. These are considered more credible by users and by search engines.</p>

<h1>A Clear Description of Your Business:</h1>
<p>If&nbsp; &nbsp;&#61 users stumble across your website, you need to make a good first impression and clearly communicate to them why your website exists in the first place. Who are you and why are you here? Make sure your homepage contains some kind of mission statement or hero message that summarizes what your business does.
